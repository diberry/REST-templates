## Template – Boilerplate code, comments, and instructions
You can use this template as the starting point for any REST call to an Azure Cognitive Service (in theory, any service). In the next few sections, we’ll talk about how you can tweak the template in a structured way to meet your product’s needs (for example: when a service needs to chunk audio or requires binary attachments).

This is a living document. If you can improve what's there, submit a pull request. Let's make this better together (laying it on thick here!).

## Common modules (libraries)

A single module is required for this template.

* [request](https://github.com/request/request) - From their site: Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.
